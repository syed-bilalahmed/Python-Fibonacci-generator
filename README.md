# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This is a Python script that dynamically generates a Fibonacci-like sequence based on user-defined starting points. Unlike the traditional Fibonacci sequence, where the first two numbers are fixed as `0` and `1`, this script allows you to input any two starting numbers, making the sequence fully customizable.

## Features

- **Dynamic Sequence Generation:** Start the sequence with any two numbers of your choice.
- **Customizable Length:** Specify how many terms you want to generate in the sequence.
- **Simple and Easy to Use:** The script is straightforward, making it easy for beginners to understand and use.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fibonacci-generator.git
   cd fibonacci-generator
